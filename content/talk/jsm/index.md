## Panel abstract

Data visualization communicates the underlying data by mapping the data to the visual properties of the graphic, such as position, size, or color. For these encodings to be effective, the mapping between the visual properties and values must preserve important differences in the data and be perceivable by the viewer. Effective color encodings in data visualization is a complex challenge, and its impact on the accuracy of visual communication is often overlooked. While it is widely accepted that color scales can deceptively manipulate a viewer's perception of the underlying data, guidelines for constructing color scales are loosely defined, difficult to express mathematically, and often difficult to apply. At this panel, researchers at the forefront of investigating the use of color in data visualizations will share their current research and tools for selecting, constructing, and evaluating color scales. We will discuss the effective matching of a color scale to the data it is encoding, perceptual uniformity, accessibility concerns, and more.


## Talk abstract

In this talk, I introduce the the topic of using color in statistical graphics. I go into the details of why we are even talking about color, how it *is* used, how it *should* be used, what issues pop up, and why it is so difficult.
