subtitle: A two-day, hands-on workshop for those who have embraced the tidyverse and want to build their own packages. We discussed how functions present to the user, functional programming tools, and Object-oriented programming with S3 (R's simplest system of OOP). We also covered the tidy eval system which allows you to use tidyverse grammar in your functions.
